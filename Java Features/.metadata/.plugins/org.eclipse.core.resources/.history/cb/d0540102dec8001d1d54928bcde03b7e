 * --> In Java, an interface is a collection of abstract methods and constants that can be implemented by a class.
 *  An interface is similar to a class, but it cannot be instantiated directly. 
 *  Instead, a class must implement the interface and provide an implementation for all of its methods.
 * 
 * --> Class inherite the interface with the help of implements keyword. 
 * 	And one class can implement one or more interface, and Also one interface can extends one or more interface
