/**
 * Abstract method mean we can only declare a method not defining the method
 * Abstract methods only define in abstract class
 * And we can not create the Object of abstract class, but we can make reference of abstract class
 * abstract class have both methods, abstract and non-abstract(Concrete method) method
 * 
 * 
 * --> In Java, an abstract class is a class that contains one or more abstract methods, 
 * which are methods without an implementation. Abstract classes are intended to be extended by other 
 * classes, which provide the implementation for the abstract methods.
 * 
 * --> The main reason why we cannot create an object of an abstract class in Java is that it doesn't 
 * make sense to create an object of a class that has no implementation for one or more of its methods. 
 * Since an abstract class is incomplete, it cannot be instantiated, meaning we cannot create objects 
 * of that class.
 * 
 * --> To summarize, an abstract class is designed to be a blueprint for other classes to 
 * extend and implement, and not to be instantiated directly. Therefore, 
 * Java does not allow us to create an object of an abstract class.
 *  
 *  --> we can create constructor in abstract class
 *  -->> Initialization of variables :
