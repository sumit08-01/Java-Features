		 * As we know we can't create object of main class,
		 * The main reason why we cannot create an object of an abstract class in Java is that 
		 * it doesn't make sense to create an object of a class that has no implementation for 
		 * one or more of its methods. Since an abstract class is incomplete, it cannot be instantiated,
		 * meaning we cannot create objects of that class.
		 * 
		 * --> You are correct, in Java, we can create objects of an abstract class using anonymous classes. 
		 * An anonymous class is a local class that does not have a name and is defined within a method or 
		 * code block. Anonymous classes are often used to provide implementation for interfaces or abstract classes.
