Java 9 @SafeVarargs Annotation: -->> 

		It is an annotation which applies on a method or constructor that takes varargs parameters. 
		It is used to ensure that the method does not perform unsafe operations on its varargs parameters.
		
	It was included in Java7 and can only be applied on
		Final methods
		Static methods
		Constructors
	
	From Java 9, it can also be used with private instance methods.

Note: The @SafeVarargs annotation can be applied only to methods that cannot be overridden. Applying to the other methods will throw a compile time error.
To apply @SaveVarargs annotation on private instance methods, compile code using Java 9 or higher versions only.

if we compile in older version it give error ---> error: Invalid SafeVarargs annotation.
