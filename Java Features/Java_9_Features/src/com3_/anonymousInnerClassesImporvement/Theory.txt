Java 9 Anonymous Inner Classes Improvement: --> 
	Java 9 introduced a new feature that allows us to use diamond operator with anonymous classes. 
	Using the diamond with anonymous classes was not allowed in Java 7.
	In Java 9, as long as the inferred type is denotable, 
	we can use the diamond operator when we create an anonymous inner class.
	Data types that can be written in Java program like int, String etc are called denotable types. 
	Java 9 compiler is enough smart and now can infer type.
	
This feature is included to Java 9, to add type inference in anonymous inner classes.
