Java 9 Stream API Improvement : --> 

1 ) Java Stream takeWhile() Method : -->
	Stream takeWhile method takes each element that matches its predicate. 
	It stops when it get unmatched element. 
	It returns a subset of elements that contains all matched elements, 
	other part of stream is discarded.
	
	
2 ) Java Stream dropWhile() Method : --> 
	Stream dropWhile method returns result on the basis of order of stream elements.

	-> Ordered stream: It returns a stream that contains elements after dropping the elements that match the given predicate.

	-> Unordered stream: It returns a stream that contains remaining elements of this stream after dropping a subset of elements that match the given predicate.

3 ) Java Stream ofNullable Method : --> 
	Stream ofNullable method returns a sequential stream that contains a single element, if non-null. 
	Otherwise, it returns an empty stream.
	It helps to handle null stream and NullPointerException.

4 ) Java Stream Iterate Method : --> 
	A new overloaded method iterate is added to the Java 9 stream interface. 
	This method allows us to iterate stream elements till the specified condition.
	It takes three arguments, seed, hasNext and next.
