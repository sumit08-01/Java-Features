Java 9 Factory Methods : -->> 
	
	Java 9 Collection library includes static factory methods for List, Set and Map interface. 
	These methods are useful to create small number of collection.
	
before java 9 ex -> 

	public class FactoryMethodsExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();  
        list.add("Java");  
        list.add("JavaFX");  
        list.add("Spring");  
        list.add("Hibernate");  
        list.add("JSP");  
        for(String l : list){  
            System.out.println(l);  
        }  
    }  
}  

Factory Methods for Collection : -->> 
	Factory methods are special type of static methods that are used to create unmodifiable instances of collections. 
	It means we can use these methods to create list, set and map of small number of elements.
	It is unmodifiable, so adding new element at run time will throw java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException

1-> List.of(); 

2-> Set.of();
	 	 Java Set interface provides a Set.of() static factory method which is used to create immutable set. 
	 	 The set instance created by this method has the following characteristcis.
	It is immutable
	No null elements
	It is serializable if all elements are serializable.
	No duplicate elements.
	The iteration order of set elements is unspecified and is subject to change.
	
	
3-> Map.of();

		In Java 9, Map includes Map.of() and Map.ofEntries() static factory methods that provide a convenient way to creae immutable maps.
		Map created by these methods has the following characteristics.
	It is immutable
	It does not allow null keys and values
	It is serializable if all keys and values are serializable
	It rejects duplicate keys at creation time
	The iteration order of mappings is unspecified and is subject to change.
	
	
	
Java 9 Map Interface ofEntries() Method Example : -->>>

	In Java 9, apart from static Map.of() methods, Map interface includes one more static method Map.ofEntries(). 
	This method is used to create a map of Map.Entry instances.
